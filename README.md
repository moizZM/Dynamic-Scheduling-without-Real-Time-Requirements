**Abstract**
Dynamic scheduling plays an important role in improving system performance in situations where real-time requirements are absent. Without the pressure of strict deadlines, schedulers can be used more effectively to achieve secondary goals, such as reducing power consumption. This is especially relevant in High-Level Synthesis (HLS), which involves three main stages  one of which is scheduling during hardware design. While the initial focus of HLS was on ensuring functional correctness, the need for energy efficiency has grown significantly over time. By dynamically adjusting tasks and deciding which parts of the hardware to use based on the nature of the workload, HLS tools become valuable in saving power without slowing down performance. This highlights the importance of dynamic scheduling in systems that do not rely on real-time constraints.
 In this paper, we explore the role of dynamic scheduling in HLS systems without real-time constraints, focusing on how it can be leveraged to enhance energy efficiency while maintaining performance. We analyze scheduling strategies and demonstrate their impact on power consumption in non-real-time scenarios
